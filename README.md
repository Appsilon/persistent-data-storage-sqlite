# Persistent data storage in Shiny.

Example of a Shiny app showcasing persistent data and app-state storage with a local SQLite backend :floppy_disk:.

The app allows the user to save/load data and app state (dropdown widgets' values), both on-demand and automatically :arrows_clockwise:.

We recommend taking a look at the code while following our [blogpost](#) :memo:.

To try it out:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Open the project file (`persistent-data-storage.Rproj`).
3. Run `renv::restore(clean = TRUE)` on your R console.
4. Run the app.
